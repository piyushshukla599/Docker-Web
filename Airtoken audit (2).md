 # <span style="color:red">Smart Contract Audit Report </span>

# Introduction

A smart contract security review of the **Staking contract**  was done by **Piyush shukla**, with a focus on the security aspects of the application's smart contracts implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Severity classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

**Impact** - the technical, economic and reputation damage of a successful attack

**Likelihood** - the chance that a particular vulnerability gets discovered and exploited

**Severity** - the overall criticality of the risk

# Findings Summary

| ID     | Title                      | Severity | Status |
| ------ | -----------------------    | -------- | ------ |
| [H-01] |Use safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer instead of TransferFrom and Transfer    | High      | Pending  |
| [H-01] |Missing maximum limit check in the newFees   | High      | Pending   |

# Detailed Findings


## [H-01]Use safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer instead of TransferFrom and Transfer

In the current contract context, you are using the transferFrom and transfer functions, which do not provide a return value. This can lead to situations where tokens may return true or false instead of reverting, potentially resulting in a direct loss of funds. To address this, it is advisable to replace transferFrom and transfer with safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer to ensure safer token transfers.

### Mitigation

use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 , And use `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` instead `TransferFrom` and `Transfer`


## Severity
High

## Status
Pending

## [H-02]  Missing maximum limit check in the newFees

In the setStakingFees function, there is a missing maximum limit check in the newFees parameter
```
//  a fee setter onlyOwner function to set staking fees %age
    function setStakingFees(uint256 _newFees) external whenNotPaused onlyOwner {
        require(_newFees!=0,"Staking fees cannot be zero");
        uint256 _oldFees=stakingFees;
        stakingFees=_newFees;
        emit StakingFeesChanged(_oldFees, _newFees);
    }

```
### Mitigation

Add `maxfees` limit in code


## Severity
High

## Status
Pending
